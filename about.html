  <h2>In My Own Words</h2>

    <p>A professional 'about you' section is typically designed to take a catalogue of a person's educational and vocational achievements.</p> 
  
    <p>Twisting the listed items together using a polished narrative that suggests that every step on that journey was made with an ambition in mind of reaching a certain career end goal.</p>
  
    <p><i>Which works brilliantly if your life has followed a linear path towards a professional objective.</i></p>

    <p>But this is the 21st century, and with so many attainable avenues to journey down, how many of us are still picking a career path in our teenage years and sticking with it until retirement?</p>
    
    <p>And how many of us are still caught up in the age-old belief that a job has to be a nine to five, a chore undertaken because the bills won't pay themselves? </p>
    
    <p>Working really doesn't have to be so dull.</p>
    
    <p> In actuality, you can nail down the things you love about this existence, and seek out a career which makes your heart sing.  </p>

    <p>So how does one write an 'about you' section that fits the mould,</p>

    <p>when each life decision was made, not methodically as steps on a ladder to reach a particular career platform,</p>
    
    <p> but as bursts of inspiration that sought something more: a raison d'Ãªtre - a reason to be? </p>
    
  
    <p>And what if that person, at some point in their life, was given the opportunity to create a website</p>
  
    <p>Well, I imagine...it might look like this...</p>
