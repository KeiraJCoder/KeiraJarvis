<h1> My Passion for Animals </h1>

<p >My entire life has had one constant, my love for the animal kingdom</p>

<p >I always knew that my life had to have animals in it, there was no other option</p>

<p >My very first work position was a volunteer experience at a Small Breeds Farm and Owl park</p>

<p >And the love affair didn't end there. </p>
<p>Since then I have travelled the world, following my passion</p>

<p>Consuming every opportunity to be around and work with animals</p>

<p>When I studied my degree, I chose a speciality of Animal Psychology, and gained, through that, an even deeper connection </p>

<p>I had the opportunity, as part of my study, to travel to South Africa and work at a game reserve</p>

<p>This was really my very first experience of working with large and wild animals </p>

<p>And I haven't looked back since, focusing much of my time and energy on studying the animal kingdom</p>

<p>I now have qualifications in Advanced Animal Care, Animal Management and Animal Behaviour and Welfare</p>

<p>And some certifications from reputable schools around the world, including in Entomology and Ecology, to name but a few</p>

<p >As well as my qualifications I have had some amazing experiences within this sector</p>

<h2>Shamwari Game Reserve</h2>


<p >One of my most treasured experienced, was at Shamwari Game Reserve, on the Eastern Cape of South Africa</p>
<p >I spent two months there, working alongside the game keeping team, and the veterinary team</p>
<p >I had the fortune of working in the rehabilitation centre, where we nursed animals back to health</p>
<p> And where we were able to rehabilitate a variety of animals back into the wild</p><br>

<br><br>

<p >Using advanced tracking equiptment we were able to monitor animals </p>

<img src="telem.jpg" alt="telemetry tracking in use" >


<p >I was also able to get up close and personal with some of the animals, such as both Black and White Rhino, Zebra and even Lions</p>

<p >During my time there, we had a huge team operation to capture, tag and release Rhino as a part of anti-poaching efforts</p>

<p >As well as these experiences, we had many others,<br> including road fixing, alien plant species removal and other less glamorous, but entirely essential, jobs. </p>

<p >My time at Shamwari, I also had the opportunity to support<br> some of the game drive staff and show guests around, resulting in some of the most amazing encounters </p>

<br>

<p>Not only that, but we were able to give back to some of the small <br>communities around the reserve, with charitable donations and building work. </p>

<h2>Born Free Foundation</h2>

<p >During my time in Africa, I had the opportunity to do some work with the Born Free Foundation</p>

<p >They had a rescue and relocation programme, for big cats, with various health issues</p>

<img src="lion4.jpg" alt="lion eating meat" >

<img src="leop2.jpg" alt="leopard eating meat" >

<p > Some of the big cats had been so badly abused, that they had no chance of surviving in the wild</p>

<p >And so Born Free had rescued them and given them a home to live out their days</p>

<h2 >SANCCOB Sea Bird Rehabilitation</h2>

<p>In a way to enhance my skills and gain even more experience in rehabilitation, I arranged some time working at SANCCOB</p>

<p>A charity in Port Elizabeth, started to rescue and rehabilitate wild sea birds</p>

<img src="peng.jpg" alt="two penguins " >

<img src="peng2.jpg" alt="penguin being held">

<img src="peng1.jpg" alt="penguins being tube fed" >

<p> During my time at SANCCOB I assisted with rescuing penguin chicks from flood waters </p>

<p >Unfortunately they were too young to feed themselves so they had to be tube fed, to help them gain strength before release</p>


<p>I am always aware of how fortunate I have been to have these experiences </p>

<p>As well as my time in Africa, I have also had time in America, teaching young people about animal husbandry </p>

<p>My love for animals continues, and seems to spill over into all aspects of my life, much to my partners chagrin </p>


<img src="pets.jpg" alt="spiders and snake pets" >

<p >My ultimate dream would be to own some kind of wildlife rescue and rehabilitation </p>

<p>Or a Rare Breeds farm </p>

<p >But until that day, I suppose I will have to make do with the animals we already have. </p>
