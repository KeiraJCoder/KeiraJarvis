<h1> Photography </h1>
<br><br>
<p>I have been incredibly fortunate to have been able to travel the world and witness some amazing things</p>
<p>My main focus in photography has always been the natural world, whether that be animals or landscapes</p>
<p>The beauty of the world has always held a fascination for me</p>
<p>And I have tried to capture that wherever I have been fortunate enough to go</p>
<p >My travels have taken me to Australia, India, South Africa, Russia, North America and across Asia</p>

<br><br>
<p>My Photography has been featured in a number of world renowned galleries.</p>
<p>And some of my photos have taken part, and placed highly, in judged competitions. </p>
<p>Both of these are facts that I am incredibly proud of</p><br>
<p>Below is a small selection of some of my photographs</p>
<br>
<p>However, if you wish to view my entire catalogue, please feel free to view</p>
