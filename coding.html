<h1>Learning to Code</h1>

<p>Coding was always something I was fascinated by, but I had no real idea of how to do it.</p>

<p>I had dabbled a little with HTML and CSS, but nothing ever really code-intensive.</p>

<p>That was until I enrolled onto a course led by <a href="http://wearecodenation.com" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>.</p>

<p>They provided the resources and education to work with Python script, and by the second week, gave me the skills I needed to project manage a game dev team.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week of learning, I had made a very simple noughts and crosses board, which doesn't sound hugely technical but was super cool anyway:</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
    <pre class="code">
        space1 = "o"
space2 = " "
space3 = "x"
space4 = "o"
space5 = "x"
space6 = " "
space7 = "o"
space8 = "x"
space9 = "o"

print ("   |   |  ")
print (f"{space1}  | {space2} | {space3} ")
print ("   |   |  ")
print("-----------")
print ("   |   |  ")
print (f"{space4}  | {space5} | {space6} ")
print ("   |   |  ")
print("-----------")
print ("   |   |  ")
print (f"{space7}  | {space8} | {space9} ")
print ("   |   |  ")

if space1 == "x" and space2 == "x" and space3 == "x":
    print ("Winner")
elif space1 == "o" and space2 == "o" and space3 == "o":
    print ("Winner")
elif space1 == "x" and space4 == "x" and space7 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space1 == "o" and space4 == "o" and space7 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space1 == "x" and space5 == "x" and space9 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space1 == "o" and space5 == "o" and space9 == "o":
    print ("Winner")
elif space7 == "x" and space5 == "x" and space3 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space7 == "o" and space5 == "o" and space3 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space4 == "o" and space5 == "o" and space6 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space4 == "x" and space5 == "x" and space6 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space8 == "o" and space5 == "o" and space2 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space8 == "x" and space5 == "x" and space2 == "x":
    print ("Winner")
elif space9 == "o" and space6 == "o" and space3 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space9 == "x" and space6 == "x" and space3 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space7 == "o" and space8 == "o" and space9 == "o":
    print ("Winner") 
elif space7 == "x" and space8 == "x" and space9 == "x":
    print ("Winner") 
else:
    print ("No winner")
    </pre>
</div>

<p>Not only that, but I had managed to build other pieces of code to do various other functions that I was quickly becoming proud of:</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
    <pre class="code">
def add_up(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

    print(add_up(7, 3))

    print(add_up(123, 480))

    balance = 1000
    pin = 1234

    def atm_function(pin_entered, amount):
        global balance 
        if pin_entered == pin:
            print("Access granted")
            if amount <= balance:
                print(f"You may withdraw that amount {amount}")
                balance -= amount 
                print("Your new balance is {}.
                Thank you for using this bank".format(balance))
        elif amount > balance:
            print("You don't have enough")
        else:
            print("That was incorrect")

    atm_function(1234, 333)
    </pre>
</div>

<p>And it wasn't only super complex pieces of code that made me smile:</p>

<div class="code-wrapper">
    <pre class="code">
x = 1
while x <= 13:
    print("Hello World")
    x += 1
    </pre>
</div>

<p>A funny little piece of code that does nothing but print "Hello World" 13 times, but it made me smile.</p>

<p>Coding had always seemed so inaccessible to me until I really threw myself into the process.</p>

<p>By the end of the second week, I project managed a team of developers through the planning, design, execution, and testing of a text-based adventure game.</p>

<p>I was blown away by the fact that a team could put together something as complex, infuriating, interesting, and just plain old fun in such a short time.</p>

<p>Our game was called Destiny, and it is something I am super proud of. You can play through here:</p>

</div>

<p>By the end of week three, I was tasked with creating and building a fully functioning website...</p>

<p>And that is where you are right now. A website built completely from scratch using nothing but HTML and CSS coding.</p>

<h1>Graduating to the Master Course</h1>

<p>Well, that was a wild ride!</p>

<p>As with most stories in my life, that wasn't <i>quite</i> the end.</p>

<p>A few months after completing the Develop course, I was trying to get work as a freelance website developer and wasn't having much luck.</p>

<p>One Friday, I got a phone call from Code Nation asking whether I was still looking for work.</p>

<p>Over the next few hours, I was interviewed and accepted onto the apprenticeship program with Code Nation.</p>

<p>Apparently, this very website was noticed by the company and my potential was recognized.</p>

<p>I started working for them the next Monday, kicking off my career as a junior software developer.</p>

<p>I began studying on the 12-week Master26 course, solidifying my HTML and CSS and boosting my JavaScript skills.</p>

<p>So here I am, again, coding some super cool things. Here are some of the projects I am super proud of:</p>

<h2>What comes next?</h2>

<p>Well I have spent the last 2 years teaching people how to code</p>
<p>I have also played around with a lot of different languages and have learned some quite complex things</p>
<p>Including how to use Unreal Engine, and programs like Blender</p>
<p>Where I was able to generate some rather impressive results</p>

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBasf-7ogz4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

<p>Who knows whats next really, like The Doctor, we will see where we end up</p>
